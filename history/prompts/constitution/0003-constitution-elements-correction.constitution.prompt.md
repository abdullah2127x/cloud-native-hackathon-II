## Prompt

you have mention this line " No Advanced Features: No priorities, tags, due dates, recurring tasks, etc" and more features. tell me are these the features or global rule. If they are the features so that should be discuss in the specs not in the constitution so discuss only the things that should be mention under the constitution not the feature specific.

## Response snapshot

Corrected analysis focusing on constitutional elements rather than specific features.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified constitution vs. specs distinction for Phase 1
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: none
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create constitution file with proper elements
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitutional elements define rules/boundaries, not features

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initially confused features with constitutional elements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create constitution with corrected understanding
