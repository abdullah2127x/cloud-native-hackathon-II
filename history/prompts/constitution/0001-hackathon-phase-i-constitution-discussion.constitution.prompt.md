## Prompt

Now this time to stasrt creating the constitution now let's discuss (don't create files now) what things are necessary to finalize the constitution? This is the main pain point for me (first tell what to put in constitution and tell me how to get and finalize that(don't tell global rules that i know)) and also tell me should i create the constitution for the phase one only for now when working on the phase one and update the constitution if need when working on the phase 2 or directly create for the whole at once

## Response snapshot

Based on the Hackathon II document and the Spec-Driven Development approach, let me break down what should go in your constitution and how to approach it:

## What to Put in Constitution for Phase I

Looking at the Hackathon document, your constitution should include:

### **Phase I Specific Constraints:**
1. **No manual coding rule** - All code must be generated by Claude Code based on specs
2. **In-memory storage only** - No persistent storage in Phase I
3. **Console interface only** - No web UI, just command-line interaction
4. **Basic CRUD operations only** - Just the 5 core features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
5. **Python project structure** - Proper organization with src/, tests/, etc.

### **Technical Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Data structure for tasks** - How tasks will be represented in memory
2. **Command interface design** - How users will interact with the console app
3. **Error handling approach** - How to handle invalid inputs, missing tasks, etc.
4. **Code organization** - How to structure the Python modules

## How to Get and Finalize These Elements

### **Step 1: Extract from Spec Document**
- Go through the Phase I requirements in the Hackathon document (lines 200-228)
- Extract all constraints, requirements, and non-functional requirements
- Note the specific deliverables mentioned

### **Step 2: Identify Missing Details**
- Task data model: What fields should a task have? (ID, title, description, status, etc.)
- Console command format: How will users interact? (e.g., `add "task title"`, `list`, `complete 1`)
- Error message format: How will errors be displayed?
- File naming conventions: How to organize Python files

### **Step 3: Make Implementation Decisions**
- Choose specific Python data structures (classes, dictionaries, etc.)
- Decide on the console interface style (menu-based vs command-based)
- Determine validation rules (title length, etc.)

## Constitution Scope: Phase I Only vs. Complete

### **Recommended Approach: Phase I Only (with future-proofing)**

Create the constitution for **Phase I only** but with these considerations:

1. **Include general project principles** that will apply to all phases:
   - Spec-driven development mandate
   - Claude Code usage requirement
   - Clean code principles
   - Testing requirements

2. **Phase-specific technical constraints** for Phase I only:
   - In-memory storage
   - Console interface
   - Basic CRUD features

3. **Extensibility considerations** (without implementing):
   - Data models designed to support persistence later
   - Architecture that can accommodate web interface later

### **Why This Approach:**
- **Focused scope** - Only address what's needed for current phase
- **Incremental development** - Follow the hackathon's phased approach
- **Avoid over-engineering** - Don't implement features for future phases
- **Easier validation** - Can verify constitution matches Phase I requirements exactly

### **Future Updates:**
When moving to Phase II, you'll update the constitution to:
- Remove in-memory only constraint
- Add web interface requirements
- Include database integration rules
- Add authentication constraints

This approach aligns with the hackathon's progressive learning approach and ensures each phase builds properly on the previous one while maintaining spec-driven discipline.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Discussed constitution scope and content for Hackathon Phase I
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: none
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create constitution file for Phase I
- 🧠 Reflection: Phase-by-phase constitution approach balances focus with future planning

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create actual constitution file based on discussion
