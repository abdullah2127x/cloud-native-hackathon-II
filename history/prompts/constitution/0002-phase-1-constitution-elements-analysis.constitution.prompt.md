## Prompt

Carefully analyze only the Phase 1 section of the provided Hackathon document.
Based strictly on Phase 1 requirements, objectives, constraints, and evaluation criteria:

-Identify all elements that should be included in the project constitution for Phase 1 only.

-Exclude any assumptions or requirements related to Phase 2 or later stages.

-Explain how to design a clear, enforceable, and strong constitution that aligns fully with Phase 1 goals.

-Ensure the constitution focuses on scope boundaries, rules, compliance, decision-making principles, and success criteria relevant only to Phase 1.

## Response snapshot

Based on the Hackathon document's Phase I section, here are the elements that should be included in the Phase 1 project constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Analyzed Phase 1 constitution elements from Hackathon document
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: none
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create actual constitution file based on analysis
- 🧠 Reflection: Clear focus on Phase 1 boundaries prevents scope creep

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create constitution file with identified elements
